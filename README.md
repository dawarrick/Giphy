# Giphy - API and animation
#This app will populate a group of buttons based on a pre-defined array.
#When you click on a button, 10 still gifs will be displayed.
#If you click on an image, it will change it from still to animated.  Click again, and it will return to the original state.
#You can also add your own search criteria for a list of gifs.
#The app will check to see if it is already in the list before adding.
#Have fun!
